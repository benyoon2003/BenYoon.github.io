        <p id="aboutme"><b>My name is Ben Yoon. I am a second year computer engineering student at Northeastern University</b> and am currently searching for a 6 month long Co-op for the summer of 2023. 
            Some things that I value in a work position are a collaborative environment, professional development, and networking. With experience in teamwork, adapting to new 
            environments, and the ability to figure things out on the spot, I believe that I can be a very good fit for this type of position.
