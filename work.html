            <p>When I came back to Southern California for summer break I immediately began searching for a summer job to help pay for expenses I would have when school is 
                back in session. It would be difficult to grow my client base for my tennis coaching business again so I decided to have a go at customer service. <b>I learned a
                lot more than I thought I would cutting fruit and serving customers at Acai Republic.</b> Because many of my coworkers were born and raised in Brazil, I became
                familiar with the culture and actually started going to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes because one of my coworkers loved the sport and recommended I try it out.
                I grew an understanding of why it is important to follow certain procedures in the store no matter how small the task, and most importantly, I gained experience
                dealing with all types of people.

        <img src="tennisc.jpg" alt="Me with my two students Isaac and Joy" style="width: 20%;" id="img">
            <p id="tenniscoach"><b>My first job ever was as a self employed tennis coach.</b> I had plenty of experience playing the game as I had been in my high school team all four years, but no idea how I 
        would teach it to kids with zero experience. On top of that, I had to find clients in the first place. My first couple months as a coach were rough, but 
        they did teach me a lot about how I should proceed with my business from there. I had built up a curriculum for my students and discovered the power of word-of-mouth 
        marketing and targeting a niche audience. My coaching business exploded when I offered one free lesson for referred clients and advertised on KakaoTalk, a messenger a lot 
        of Korean people use. When summer break started, I had to spend the majority of my time on the courts because I had such a steady flow of customers. This actually became
        problematic because it was so difficult to schedule all of my clients. I was always good at managing my time, but managing twenty different appointments quite frankly
        blew up in my face. Sometimes, two different clients would show up in the same time slot and I would apologize profusely for wasting their time. <b>One of the most 
            valuable lessons I learned running my coaching business was not to neglect time management and to set aside a part of the day to solely focus on it.</b> </p>
