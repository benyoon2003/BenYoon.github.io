		<p>During the summer of 2022, I decided to utilize a ten day free trial at Gracie University in Torrance, California. <b>Contrary to beliefs I held about martial arts, the sport
			actually advocated for pacifism, respect, and avoiding conflict more than engaging in it.</b> I was also pleasantly surprised by the fact that even in the case of conflict, 
			the techniques taught in BJJ focused on restraining the opponent instead of causing harm. This aspect of the sport was very attractive to me because I am the type of 
			person that usually avoids conflicts and I despise violence. On top of learning the techniques, I had an incredible time connecting with the other students in the classes,
			who were also very passionate about the sport.

		<h3 id="weight">Weightlifting</h3>

		<p>I initally started calisthenics in order to qualify for the Congressional Award. It initally felt like a chore, something I dreaded everyday. However, seeing the steady
			progress I was making in terms of strength and aesthetics had me hooked. I started calisthenics my freshman year of highschool and by the end of my senior year,
			I could do so many reps of pullups, pushups, situps, and squats that my workout would last close to three hours. In order to save time and add more intensity, I 
			began weightlifting. <b>Currently, I dedicate around two hours six days a week to hitting the gym and have changed my eating habits for a more healthy and sustainable
				lifestyle.</b> </p>

		<h3 id="rave">Raving</h3>
		<img src="rave.jpg" alt="Las Vegas EDC" style="width: 30%;" id="img">
		<p>In May of 2022, I went to the Electric Daisy Festival in Las Vegas, one of the biggest EDM music festivals in the world with six other friends. I had gone to plenty
			of concerts in Boston and saw amazing artists like SLANDER, Marauda, and Dabin. However, the sheer size of the stages and number of people at EDC was mindblowing. 
			I got to see many of my favorite artists and made friends from all around the world. EDM festival culture is often stigmatized due to heavy drug use and incidents 
			occuring within the crowd; however, I believe the positive vibes, empowering messages, and accepting culture of festivals outweigh the negatives.

		<h3 id="read">Reading</h3>
		<img src="storm.jpg" alt="The book I am reading right now." style="width: 25%;" id="img">
		<p>Growing up, I always enjoyed reading. <b>I always prefered novels over movies because I could imagine the scenes in my head as I formed interpretations of the words 
			on the page.</b> Movies do not offer the same kind of imaginative freedom. What you see is what you get. As school became more serious and reading became a method of
			stuffing equations and scientific concepts in my head, I read less and less. The novel that resparked my passion for reading was actually Rich Dad Poor Dad, a novel 
			that teaches financial literacy. After reading it, I felt that there was actually a lot of very valuable information I could learn from books. This led me down a path
			of reading various self help books, such as <i>Atomic Habits</i>, <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i>, <i>Can't Hurt Me</i>, and <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>. 
			Soon enough I got sick of reading non-fiction novels and came back to my roots. Recently, I began reading <i> The Way of Kings</i> from the Stormlight Archives.
