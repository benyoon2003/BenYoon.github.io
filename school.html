            <p><b>This program scrapes different subreddits to find the most talked about stocks.</b> The program first scrapes either r/wallstreebets, r/stocks, r/StockMarket, r/Stock_Picks, 
                compares the words in the top 100 posts of the day to a list of all the stock abbreviations on the NASDAQ. Finds the top three most mentioned stocks, and uses a yahoo 
                finance API to pull all the info about the three stocks. The program then uses tkinter to display all the info on the screen.

            <p>For my fundamentals of computer engineering class final project, my partner and I created a digital version of Scrabble using Python only. <b>Using an object oriented 
                design, the code was split into two main sections: first, several classes that make up the backbone of the game functions were designed and tested.</b> Next, a Graphical User 
                Interface (GUI) was developed to integrate those functions with user inputs. The most difficult part of this project was programming the backend so that errors 
                would be raised in the case that the user inputs broke the rules of the game. The video above demonstrates how our game worked.</p>

            <p>For my cornerstone of engineering class final project, my teammates and I were tasked with creating an interactive game from scratch that would be put on
                display at the Boston Children's Museum. <b>We created a game that simulates a simple checkup at the doctors office utilizng arduino components, such as photo 
                resistors, LEDs, and used MATLAB to code our redboard.</b> In order to make the game more appealing to our intended users, we also painted our game for cartoonish 
                effect. </p>

            <p>Tennis was a huge part of my high school career. Many believe that tennis is not a team sport and that may be true in the professional scene; however, in 
            high school and college, you must keep up a sense of camaraderie amongst teammates to win championships. <b>Being a part of a very competitive divison 1 tennis team taught 
                me the importance of keeping up a positive attitude for your team's sake and staying close with members of the team.</b>

        <img src="images/boat.jpg" alt="Solar Boat in progress" style="width: 30%;" id="img">
            <p>When I became the captain of my solar boat club, there were no adult mentors because their kids had graduated in the previous school year. I was left with half a team 
            and had close to no experience working on boats. Before the season began, I was able to fill up the remaining spots with many bright minds from my grade and the 
            grades below securing the future of the club even after I graduated. <b>Due to such a spiked interest in the club, we were able to enter the annual Solar Cup competition
            held by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and came in 5th place out of 36 teams.</b>
